Arhcitecture suggestion for rhino_mcp
---

### Components Overview

1. **MCP Server (External Python Process):**  
   - **Role:** Acts as the gateway between the LLM (e.g., Claude) and Rhino. It exposes functions decorated with something like `@mcp.tool()`.  
   - **Operation:** When the LLM issues a command, the server translates it into a JSON command (e.g., `{"type": "create_object", "params": {"type": "CUBE", "location": [0,0,0]}}`) and sends it over a TCP socket to the Rhino-side script.
   - **Note:** This process can run independently, using standard Python (CPython), and manages the MCP logic without interfering with Rhino.

2. **Rhino-side Script (IronPython):**  
   - **Role:** Runs inside Rhino 7 (IronPython) and listens for incoming JSON commands from the MCP server.  
   - **Operation:**  
     - **Socket Server:** Implements a socket-based listener that runs in a background thread (or via an asynchronous event timer) to ensure Rhino's main thread stays unblocked.  
     - **Command Dispatcher:** Once a command is received, it parses the JSON and uses the Command Pattern to map the command to the corresponding RhinoCommon function (or a small wrapper around it).  
     - **Main Thread Execution:** Since many Rhino operations must execute on the main thread, the script should schedule the command execution appropriately (for example, via Rhino's `RhinoApp.Idle` event or a thread-safe queue dispatch mechanism).
     - **Response Flow:** After executing, it sends a response (e.g., status, object IDs) back to the MCP server over the same socket connection.

3. **Communication Flow:**  
   - **User ‚Üí LLM:** The user describes what they need (e.g., "create a cube at [0,0,0]").  
   - **LLM ‚Üí MCP Server:** The LLM calls the appropriate MCP tool.  
   - **MCP Server ‚Üí Rhino Addon:** The server sends a JSON command via TCP.  
   - **Rhino Addon ‚Üí Rhino:** The Rhino script receives, dispatches, and executes the command.  
   - **Rhino ‚Üí MCP Server:** Results and status are sent back, eventually relayed to the user.

### Technical Implementation Outline

#### 1. MCP Server (External Process)

- **Implementation:**  
  Use a standard Python socket server (or an HTTP server if preferred) that listens for LLM requests, translates them into MCP tool calls, and sends the appropriate JSON command to Rhino.  
- **Example Pseudocode:**

  ```python
  # mcp_server.py (External process using CPython)
  import socket
  import json

  HOST = 'localhost'
  PORT = 6000  # Port where Rhino-side script listens

  def send_command(command):
      # command is a dict like {"type": "create_object", "params": {"type": "CUBE", "location": [0,0,0]}}
      with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
          s.connect((HOST, PORT))
          s.sendall(json.dumps(command).encode('utf-8'))
          # Optionally, wait for a response:
          response = s.recv(1024)
          print("Response:", response.decode('utf-8'))

  # Example usage:
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      cmd = {"type": "create_object", "params": {"type": "CUBE", "location": [0, 0, 0]}}
      send_command(cmd)
  ```

#### 2. Rhino-side Script (IronPython in Rhino 7)

- **Implementation:**  
  This script is loaded and run within Rhino. It uses IronPython's threading and the built-in `socket` module to start a background server.  
- **Key Points:**  
  - **Background Listener:** Run in a separate thread so it never blocks Rhino's main thread.  
  - **Main Thread Dispatching:** Use Rhino's mechanisms (e.g., `RhinoApp.Idle` event) to execute any RhinoCommon commands safely on the main thread.
- **Example Pseudocode:**

  ```python
  # RhinoMCP_listener.py (to be run inside Rhino's IronPython)
  import socket
  import threading
  import json
  import System.Threading
  import Rhino
  import scriptcontext as sc

  HOST = 'localhost'
  PORT = 6000  # Must match the MCP server port

  def process_command(command):
      # This is the command dispatcher.
      # For now, just a simple dispatcher that prints the command.
      # In a real implementation, map command["type"] to a function call.
      Rhino.RhinoApp.WriteLine("Received command: " + str(command))
      # Execute Rhino operations here, ensuring execution on main thread if needed.
      # For example, schedule via RhinoApp.Idle event if necessary.
      # Dummy response:
      response = {"status": "success", "details": "Executed " + command["type"]}
      return response

  def socket_listener():
      sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
      sock.bind((HOST, PORT))
      sock.listen(1)
      Rhino.RhinoApp.WriteLine("MCP Listener started on port " + str(PORT))
      while True:
          conn, addr = sock.accept()
          try:
              data = conn.recv(1024)
              if not data:
                  continue
              command = json.loads(data.decode('utf-8'))
              # Schedule command execution on main thread:
              def run_command():
                  resp = process_command(command)
                  conn.sendall(json.dumps(resp).encode('utf-8'))
                  conn.close()
              # Using RhinoApp.Idle to defer execution onto the main thread
              Rhino.RhinoApp.Idle += lambda sender, e: run_command()
          except Exception as e:
              Rhino.RhinoApp.WriteLine("Error processing command: " + str(e))
              conn.close()

  # Start the listener in a background thread:
  thread = threading.Thread(target=socket_listener)
  thread.IsBackground = True
  thread.Start()

  Rhino.RhinoApp.WriteLine("Rhino MCP listener running...")
  ```

### How to Run

- **MCP Server:** Run `mcp_server.py` as an external process on your machine. This is the process that your LLM (Claude) would interact with.  
- **Rhino Script:** Load and execute `RhinoMCP_listener.py` inside Rhino 7's IronPython editor. This will start a background socket listener that accepts commands and dispatches them to Rhino's API without blocking the main thread.

---

### Final Remarks

- **Simplicity:** This solution uses a socket-based interface with threading to avoid blocking Rhino's main thread.  
- **Scalability:** The command dispatcher pattern allows you to later expand the list of commands by simply mapping JSON `"type"` values to specific Rhino functions.  
- **MCP Alignment:** Both components align with the MCP concept by keeping command translation and execution distinct and modular.

This quick and dirty setup provides a solid starting point for integrating Rhino operations with an LLM-based workflow without delving too deep into custom plugin development for Rhino 7.

19.03.2025 - Afternoon
Achievements:
‚úÖ Rhino Script Implementation: Successfully implemented the Rhino-side script with proper IronPython 2.7 compatibility.
‚úÖ Connection Handling: Implemented robust socket communication between MCP server and Rhino script.
‚úÖ Command Execution: Successfully executing Rhino commands through the MCP protocol.

Key Learnings:
üí° Full Python Path is Crucial: When using conda environments with Claude Desktop, always use the full path to the Python interpreter in the configuration.
‚ö†Ô∏è uvx Incompatibility with Conda (in Claude): uvx might not reliably resolve local packages within Claude Desktop's environment when using conda.
‚úÖ Direct Module Execution Works Best: Running the server directly as a Python module (python -m rhino_mcp.server) is more robust for conda integration.
üîë blender_mcp as a Blueprint: Closely following the structure and configuration of the working blender_mcp project is key to success.

New Learnings:
üîß IronPython 2.7 Compatibility:
   - No f-strings: Use .format() instead
   - No json.JSONDecodeError: Use ValueError for JSON parsing errors
   - No MainLoop.BeginInvoke: Use RhinoApp.Idle event for main thread execution
   - Socket handling needs special consideration for IronPython 2.7

üîå Connection Management:
   - Keep connections open for multiple commands
   - Use proper error handling for socket operations
   - Implement clean connection closure only when necessary
   - Handle client disconnections gracefully

üîÑ Command Execution Flow:
   - Use RhinoApp.Idle event for main thread operations
   - Implement proper response handling before closing connections
   - Maintain connection state between commands
   - Use proper error responses for failed operations

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
   - Don't close connections prematurely
   - Don't use Python 3.x features in Rhino script
   - Don't block the main thread with socket operations
   - Don't ignore IronPython 2.7 limitations
