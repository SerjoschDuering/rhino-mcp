# Project goal introduction

THe goal of this project is to create a MCP ( model context protocol) for Rhino (and later for grasshopper, but we focus on rhino for now).
We take the project strucutre in the folder "blender_mcp" as an example to follow, there we get all MCP related knowlege and inspiration and reference from. Note that i just copied the blender mcp related code into a new parent folder "blender_mcp" so some import paths might be faulty, but that doesnt matter as we only use it as a reference to rapidly build our rhino mcp. 
We want to buidl a rhino_mcp / port in the rhino_mcp folder.
